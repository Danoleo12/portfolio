            <h1 id="about">Hi I am Danick</h1>
            <p>A developer fueled by a love for coding, gaming, and all things web-related. My journey has been shaped by my enthusiasm for Java programming, web development, and exploring the endless possibilities of databases and SQL.
            </p>
            <p>While design isn't my forte, I'm passionate about creating functional, well-structured solutions that deliver real value. Whether it's building dynamic websites or optimizing database workflows, I thrive on solving problems and turning ideas into reality</p>
            <p>When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me immersed in gaming exploring new worlds and sharpening my strategic skills. My goal is to keep growing as a developer, refine my expertise, and collaborate with others to bring projects to life

            <ul>
                <li>I got my first part time job in <b>November 2022</b> with <a title="Link will open in a new tab" href="https://gdi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDI Integrated Services</a> as a janitor. There, I have learnt to work within a team. Even though the work wasn't too formal, I have learnt how to express myself within a work place and how to share my ideas with my teammates and my supervisors
                I have Kept that position until the end of <b>October 2023.</b></li>
                <li>I came back to same company on <b>October 2024</b> as a team Lead. Here is where I have learnt and applied how to handle a team and build strong connections with customer, teammates and management. <b>April 2024</b>, GDI lost their contract with the GWL and comes the <b>LAY OFF.</b></li>
                <li>Thanks to the <a title="Link will open in a new tab" href="https://seiulocal2.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEIU</a>, a union representing and fighting for janitor's right, most of us (Current unionised workers), have been accepted by the new company: <a title="Link will open in a new tab" href="https://bee-clean.com/"><b>Bee-Clean Building Maintenance.</b></a> From <b>April 14th</b> I am a resposible of a team of 10 janitors.</li>
                <li>This seems irrelevant but why do I add it here? Well those position not only give me the teamwork skills I have, But also helped improve my confidence when expressing myself in english.</li>
